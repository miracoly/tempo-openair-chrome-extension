==== popup.ts
Script file for `popup.html`, which defines the view of the extensions popup.

==== content.ts

[source,json]
.manifest.json
----
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["https://*.app.openair.com/*"],
----
`content.js` has access to the sites DOM and can interact with it. Requests to other domains get send from the page itself and therefore get blocked by CORS.

==== background.ts
Functions as a service-worker in the background, like the backend of an extension. From here, you can fetch other domains which are listed inside `manifest.json`.

[source,json]
.manifest.json
----
"host_permissions": ["https://api.tempo.io/*"],
