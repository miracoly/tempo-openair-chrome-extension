== For Developers
=== Overview
* Chrome Extension: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/[API Reference]

==== manifest.json
Main configuration file for a Chrome extension. Here you define permissions etc.

==== popup.ts
Script file for `popup.html`, which defines the view of the extensions popup.

==== content.ts
Gets injected into the website, if matched with urls inside `manifest.json`.

[source,json]
.manifest.json
----
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["https://*.app.openair.com/*"],
----
`content.js` has access to the sites DOM and can interact with it. Requests to other domains get send from the page itself and therefore get blocked by CORS.

==== background.ts
Functions as a service-worker in the background, like the backend of an extension. From here, you can fetch other domains which are listed inside `manifest.json`.

[source,json]
.manifest.json
----
"host_permissions": ["https://api.tempo.io/*"],
----

=== Build
==== For Production
* `npm run build`

==== For Development
* `npm run watch`
* Generate styles: `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/popup/styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css`

=== Logging
- `console.log()` in `content.ts` gets logged in normal page console.
- `background.ts` and `popup.ts` logs get printed to different console. To view, right-click extension icon in chrome menu and click `Inspect Popup`.
